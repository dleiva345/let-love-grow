The goal of our app is to strengthen relationships between couples.

## This is how it works:
The app will have a few features that will keep couples in perfect harmony:
   * Messaging - where couples can stay in constant contact with each other throughout the day and send emojis/giphys
   * To-do list - where couples can track tasks 
   * Calendar - where couples mark important days (and will receive system notifications, i.e., anniversaries, etc.)
   * Photo album - where couples can upload images (and will receive system notifications of images for certain dates)
   * Wallet - where couples can add money to shared piggybank and to budget 
   * Ads - (add-on) coupons for events in the area

## Technologies:
   * React.js
   * HTML
   * CSS- Bootstrap
